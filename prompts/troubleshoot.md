## Context Variables
- **Architecture**: Clean Architecture
- **Language**: TypeScript

## Guidelines for Fixing

When analyzing this error, please keep these project standards in mind:

1. **Centralized Error Handling**: 
   - Ensure the error uses the standard custom error classes from `src/errors/` (e.g., `ApiError`, `NotFoundError`, `BadRequestError`).
   - If an error occurs in a controller, it should be passed to the global error middleware via `throw` (for async handlers, or `next(error)` in MVC).
2. **Standard Status Codes**:
   - Verify that appropriate status codes from `httpCodes` are being used correctly, rather than generic 500s unless unexpected.
3. **Dependencies**:
   - Check if this is a connection issue (e.g., Database, Kafka, Redis) and see if our standard configuration or health checks provide hints.
4. **Fix Suggestion**:
   - Explain *why* the error happened.
   - Provide a targeted code fix matching our coding style (TypeScript, Clean Architecture).
   - Only modify what is strictly necessary to solve the issue.
